/* Greet Thanks to Allah Azza Wa Jalla
   Prophet Muhammad Shalallahu Alaihi Wassalam

   Only Islam has rules from head to toe, 
   haram and halal, from birth to death, yesterday, 
   today and tomorrow everything has been arranged, 
   why are you still closing yourself ?

   "Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,
   then established Himself on the Throne, conducting every affair. 
   None can intercede except by His permission. That is Allah—your Lord, 
   so worship Him ˹alone˺. Will you not then be mindful ?" (QS Yunus 3)
